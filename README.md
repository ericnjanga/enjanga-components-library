# Eric Njanga Portfolio ‚Äì Component Library

This is a React component library built for Eric Njanga‚Äôs portfolio. The library is designed for **consumption only** ‚Äî JavaScript and CSS files are minified and optimized for external use.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This library depends on the [IBM Carbon Design System](https://carbondesignsystem.com/). It uses Carbon‚Äôs components, patterns, and styles. To work correctly, **Carbon must be installed and configured** in the consuming project.

## üõ† Development Workflow

### Storybook for UI Development

Storybook is used to build and test components in isolation. The development environment closely mirrors production by:

- Injecting Carbon styles via `.storybook/preview.ts`
- Including only the library‚Äôs component styles in the final npm package (not Carbon‚Äôs) to avoid duplication and reduce package size

# Philosophy

## Scalabiity

This component library follows the following principles:

- Modularity: Components built in isolation and made easier to extens
- Reusability: Components focused on a single purpose, needed in many places
- Separation of concerns: Larger components recompose smaller components in a cleaner way

## Robustness

- Strong typing: Component props are strictly typed

## Flexibility

- Flexible rendering: Some components support dynamic wrapper tags (div/section, ul/ol, ...)
- Conditional rendering: Using safely checks before rendering (list?.content?.length)

## Performance Optimization

A memoized version is offered for components that tends to grow in complexity, re-renders frequency, and have diverse usage patterns. These components are:
Most components can be imported in their .

- HeadlinedList
- List
  Note: Lightweight components unusally don't need to be memoized
