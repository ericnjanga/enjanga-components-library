# Eric Njanga Portfolio ‚Äì Component Library

This is a [React component library](https://www.chromatic.com/library?appId=6856ac512f4faa67a7d9c5c2) built for Eric Njanga‚Äôs portfolio. The library is designed for **consumption only** ‚Äî JavaScript and CSS files are minified and optimized for external use.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This library depends on the [IBM Carbon Design System](https://carbondesignsystem.com/). It leverages Carbon‚Äôs components, patterns, and styles. To function correctly, **Carbon must be installed and configured** in the consuming project.

## üöÄ Stack & Features

- **Next.js (React)**
- **TypeScript**
- **IBM Carbon Design System**
- **SASS**
- **Storybook**
- **Chromatic CLI** (for live Storybook deployment)
- **React Testing Library**

## üõ† Development Workflow

### Storybook for UI Development

Storybook is used to develop and test components in isolation. The development environment mirrors production by:

- Injecting Carbon styles via `.storybook/preview.ts`
- Including **only** the component styles from this library in the npm package (not Carbon‚Äôs), to reduce duplication and keep the package lightweight

# Philosophy

A few observations on what's the thoughts behind the creation of this components' library

## Carbon's Selective implementation

[Carbon](https://carbondesignsystem.com/) is a toolbox from which I pick my library's features. It is the design prototypes that drive my implementation decisions. For example, the "ContactButton" component will always be a primary, or secondary button at most and will always display a select number of icons related to the action of connecting with someone (email, chat, ...). Therefore, the component will have limited properties, options, and the story will have limites edge cases (no need of a "ContactButton" story with no icons, or in danger mode). See the component story for illustration.

the component will only offer the following possibilities to consummers:

- text: (string)
- kind: 'primary' | 'secondary' (Optional and 'primary' by default)
- size: 'sm' | 'md' (Optional and 'md' by default)

## Scalabiity

This component library follows the following principles:

- Modularity: Components built in isolation and made easier to extens
- Reusability: Components focused on a single purpose, needed in many places
- Separation of concerns: Larger components recompose smaller components in a cleaner way

## Robustness

- Strong typing: Component props are strictly typed

## Flexibility

- Flexible rendering: Some components support dynamic wrapper tags (div/section, ul/ol, ...)
- Conditional rendering: Using safely checks before rendering (list?.content?.length)

## Performance Optimization

A memoized version is offered for components that tends to grow in complexity, re-renders frequency, and have diverse usage patterns. These components are:
Most components can be imported in their .

- HeadlinedList
- List
  Note: Lightweight components unusally don't need to be memoized

# How to use this component library

## Installation:

Run the commands:

- yarn install (All hey dependencies will be installed)

# List of exported components

- See the list on: src/components/index.ts

## Ready for export after changes

yarn build (Bundles up the component library)
yarn link (Registers the component library with yarn)
