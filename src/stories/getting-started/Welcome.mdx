# Welcome to Eric Njanga Design System  

## Introduction
I've created this component library to help me provide a solid foundation for my 2025 porfolio while soling three interesting challenges:
- <b>Inconsistent UI</b> — Developers were usually re-implementing common components like buttons, modals, and accordions, leading to design drift.
- Reduced productivity — Duplicate code is common in most dev projects. It slows down development and makes maintenance harder.
- Accessibility Notes gaps — Accessibility Notes is a business standard today. Embedding WCAG standards in library components is a smart way to reduce compliance risks.
